### Still Needs:
- [] Boot Menu and BIOS Keys (if possible)
- [] Build Sheet PDFs
- [] Foolproofing tips for things like what exactly to google or what kinds of branding to look for on a desktop case


### Bugs:
- [] Ethernet speed module broken
- [] Only can detect and list 1 drive
- [] Can't reliably list total number of RAM slots

### Issues:
- [] Nvidia drivers may not be properly installed to scrape VRAM, may need an extra package installed
- [] Product name may not show manufacturer
- [] Disk sizes are not very accurate in Linux
